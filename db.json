As we have already discussed over the phone, you can now starting feeding the orgranism. We have sent the required materials for you to develop it. The package should already have arrived. Go to your DNA Modificiator and place the given part onto the orgranism. To prove this works, the Organism should be able to consume food. Test this out by using the Microscope.  // Best regards, Milo [CEO of Tiny Labs]",
